Chapter 10  Swiss-Prot and ExPASy
=================================

10.1  Parsing Swiss-Prot files
------------------------------

Swiss-Prot
(`http://www.expasy.org/sprot <http://www.expasy.org/sprot>`__) is a
hand-curated database of protein sequences. Biopython can parse the
“plain text” Swiss-Prot file format, which is still used for the UniProt
Knowledgebase which combined Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR-PSD. We do not
(yet) support the UniProtKB XML file format.

10.1.1  Parsing Swiss-Prot records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Section \ `5.3.2 <#sec:SeqIO_ExPASy_and_SwissProt>`__, we described
how to extract the sequence of a Swiss-Prot record as a ``SeqRecord``
object. Alternatively, you can store the Swiss-Prot record in a
``Bio.SwissProt.Record`` object, which in fact stores the complete
information contained in the Swiss-Prot record. In this Section, we
describe how to extract ``Bio.SwissProt.Record`` objects from a
Swiss-Prot file.

To parse a Swiss-Prot record, we first get a handle to a Swiss-Prot
record. There are several ways to do so, depending on where and how the
Swiss-Prot record is stored:

-  Open a Swiss-Prot file locally:
  
   .. code:: python
      
       >>> handle = open("myswissprotfile.dat")

-  Open a gzipped Swiss-Prot file:

   .. code:: python

       >>> import gzip
       >>> handle = gzip.open("myswissprotfile.dat.gz")

-  Open a Swiss-Prot file over the internet:

   .. code:: python

       >>> import urllib
       >>> handle = urllib.urlopen("http://www.somelocation.org/data/someswissprotfile.dat")

-  Open a Swiss-Prot file over the internet from the ExPASy database
   (see section `10.5.1 <#subsec:expasy_swissprot>`__):

   .. code:: python

       >>> from Bio import ExPASy
       >>> handle = ExPASy.get_sprot_raw(myaccessionnumber)

The key point is that for the parser, it doesn’t matter how the handle
was created, as long as it points to data in the Swiss-Prot format.

We can use ``Bio.SeqIO`` as described in
Section \ `5.3.2 <#sec:SeqIO_ExPASy_and_SwissProt>`__ to get file format
agnostic ``SeqRecord`` objects. Alternatively, we can use
``Bio.SwissProt`` get ``Bio.SwissProt.Record`` objects, which are a much
closer match to the underlying file format.

To read one Swiss-Prot record from the handle, we use the function
``read()``:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import SwissProt
    >>> record = SwissProt.read(handle)

This function should be used if the handle points to exactly one
Swiss-Prot record. It raises a ``ValueError`` if no Swiss-Prot record
was found, and also if more than one record was found.

We can now print out some information about this record:

.. code:: python

    >>> print record.description
    'RecName: Full=Chalcone synthase 3; EC=2.3.1.74; AltName: Full=Naringenin-chalcone synthase 3;'
    >>> for ref in record.references:
    ...     print "authors:", ref.authors
    ...     print "title:", ref.title
    ...
    authors: Liew C.F., Lim S.H., Loh C.S., Goh C.J.;
    title: "Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of chalcone synthase cDNAs of
    Bromheadia finlaysoniana.";
    >>> print record.organism_classification
    ['Eukaryota', 'Viridiplantae', 'Streptophyta', 'Embryophyta', ..., 'Bromheadia']

To parse a file that contains more than one Swiss-Prot record, we use
the ``parse`` function instead. This function allows us to iterate over
the records in the file.

For example, let’s parse the full Swiss-Prot database and collect all
the descriptions. You can download this from the `ExPAYs FTP
site <ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.dat.gz>`__
as a single gzipped-file ``uniprot_sprot.dat.gz`` (about 300MB). This is
a compressed file containing a single file, ``uniprot_sprot.dat`` (over
1.5GB).

As described at the start of this section, you can use the Python
library ``gzip`` to open and uncompress a ``.gz`` file, like this:

.. code:: python

    >>> import gzip
    >>> handle = gzip.open("uniprot_sprot.dat.gz")

However, uncompressing a large file takes time, and each time you open
the file for reading in this way, it has to be decompressed on the fly.
So, if you can spare the disk space you’ll save time in the long run if
you first decompress the file to disk, to get the ``uniprot_sprot.dat``
file inside. Then you can open the file for reading as usual:

.. code:: python

    >>> handle = open("uniprot_sprot.dat")

As of June 2009, the full Swiss-Prot database downloaded from ExPASy
contained 468851 Swiss-Prot records. One concise way to build up a list
of the record descriptions is with a list comprehension:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import SwissProt
    >>> handle = open("uniprot_sprot.dat")
    >>> descriptions = [record.description for record in SwissProt.parse(handle)]
    >>> len(descriptions)
    468851
    >>> descriptions[:5]
    ['RecName: Full=Protein MGF 100-1R;',
     'RecName: Full=Protein MGF 100-1R;',
     'RecName: Full=Protein MGF 100-1R;',
     'RecName: Full=Protein MGF 100-1R;',
     'RecName: Full=Protein MGF 100-2L;']

Or, using a for loop over the record iterator:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import SwissProt
    >>> descriptions = []
    >>> handle = open("uniprot_sprot.dat")
    >>> for record in SwissProt.parse(handle):
    ...     descriptions.append(record.description)
    ...
    >>> len(descriptions)
    468851

Because this is such a large input file, either way takes about eleven
minutes on my new desktop computer (using the uncompressed
``uniprot_sprot.dat`` file as input).

It is equally easy to extract any kind of information you’d like from
Swiss-Prot records. To see the members of a Swiss-Prot record, use

.. code:: python

    >>> dir(record)
    ['__doc__', '__init__', '__module__', 'accessions', 'annotation_update',
    'comments', 'created', 'cross_references', 'data_class', 'description',
    'entry_name', 'features', 'gene_name', 'host_organism', 'keywords',
    'molecule_type', 'organelle', 'organism', 'organism_classification',
    'references', 'seqinfo', 'sequence', 'sequence_length',
    'sequence_update', 'taxonomy_id']

10.1.2  Parsing the Swiss-Prot keyword and category list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Swiss-Prot also distributes a file ``keywlist.txt``, which lists the
keywords and categories used in Swiss-Prot. The file contains entries in
the following form:

.. code:: python

    ID   2Fe-2S.
    AC   KW-0001
    DE   Protein which contains at least one 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster: 2 iron
    DE   atoms complexed to 2 inorganic sulfides and 4 sulfur atoms of
    DE   cysteines from the protein.
    SY   Fe2S2; [2Fe-2S] cluster; [Fe2S2] cluster; Fe2/S2 (inorganic) cluster;
    SY   Di-mu-sulfido-diiron; 2 iron, 2 sulfur cluster binding.
    GO   GO:0051537; 2 iron, 2 sulfur cluster binding
    HI   Ligand: Iron; Iron-sulfur; 2Fe-2S.
    HI   Ligand: Metal-binding; 2Fe-2S.
    CA   Ligand.
    //
    ID   3D-structure.
    AC   KW-0002
    DE   Protein, or part of a protein, whose three-dimensional structure has
    DE   been resolved experimentally (for example by X-ray crystallography or
    DE   NMR spectroscopy) and whose coordinates are available in the PDB
    DE   database. Can also be used for theoretical models.
    HI   Technical term: 3D-structure.
    CA   Technical term.
    //
    ID   3Fe-4S.
    ...

The entries in this file can be parsed by the ``parse`` function in the
``Bio.SwissProt.KeyWList`` module. Each entry is then stored as a
``Bio.SwissProt.KeyWList.Record``, which is a Python dictionary.

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio.SwissProt import KeyWList
    >>> handle = open("keywlist.txt")
    >>> records = KeyWList.parse(handle)
    >>> for record in records:
    ...     print record['ID']
    ...     print record['DE']

This prints

.. code:: python

    2Fe-2S.
    Protein which contains at least one 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster: 2 iron atoms
    complexed to 2 inorganic sulfides and 4 sulfur atoms of cysteines from the
    protein.
    ...

10.2  Parsing Prosite records
-----------------------------

Prosite is a database containing protein domains, protein families,
functional sites, as well as the patterns and profiles to recognize
them. Prosite was developed in parallel with Swiss-Prot. In Biopython, a
Prosite record is represented by the ``Bio.ExPASy.Prosite.Record``
class, whose members correspond to the different fields in a Prosite
record.

In general, a Prosite file can contain more than one Prosite records.
For example, the full set of Prosite records, which can be downloaded as
a single file (``prosite.dat``) from the `ExPASy FTP
site <ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite/prosite.dat>`__, contains
2073 records (version 20.24 released on 4 December 2007). To parse such
a file, we again make use of an iterator:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import Prosite
    >>> handle = open("myprositefile.dat")
    >>> records = Prosite.parse(handle)

We can now take the records one at a time and print out some
information. For example, using the file containing the complete Prosite
database, we’d find

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import Prosite
    >>> handle = open("prosite.dat")
    >>> records = Prosite.parse(handle)
    >>> record = records.next()
    >>> record.accession
    'PS00001'
    >>> record.name
    'ASN_GLYCOSYLATION'
    >>> record.pdoc
    'PDOC00001'
    >>> record = records.next()
    >>> record.accession
    'PS00004'
    >>> record.name
    'CAMP_PHOSPHO_SITE'
    >>> record.pdoc
    'PDOC00004'
    >>> record = records.next()
    >>> record.accession
    'PS00005'
    >>> record.name
    'PKC_PHOSPHO_SITE'
    >>> record.pdoc
    'PDOC00005'

and so on. If you’re interested in how many Prosite records there are,
you could use

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import Prosite
    >>> handle = open("prosite.dat")
    >>> records = Prosite.parse(handle)
    >>> n = 0
    >>> for record in records: n+=1
    ...
    >>> print n
    2073

To read exactly one Prosite from the handle, you can use the ``read``
function:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import Prosite
    >>> handle = open("mysingleprositerecord.dat")
    >>> record = Prosite.read(handle)

This function raises a ValueError if no Prosite record is found, and
also if more than one Prosite record is found.

10.3  Parsing Prosite documentation records
-------------------------------------------

In the Prosite example above, the ``record.pdoc`` accession numbers
``'PDOC00001'``, ``'PDOC00004'``, ``'PDOC00005'`` and so on refer to
Prosite documentation. The Prosite documentation records are available
from ExPASy as individual files, and as one file (``prosite.doc``)
containing all Prosite documentation records.

We use the parser in ``Bio.ExPASy.Prodoc`` to parse Prosite
documentation records. For example, to create a list of all accession
numbers of Prosite documentation record, you can use

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import Prodoc
    >>> handle = open("prosite.doc")
    >>> records = Prodoc.parse(handle)
    >>> accessions = [record.accession for record in records]

Again a ``read()`` function is provided to read exactly one Prosite
documentation record from the handle.

10.4  Parsing Enzyme records
----------------------------

ExPASy’s Enzyme database is a repository of information on enzyme
nomenclature. A typical Enzyme record looks as follows:

.. code:: python

    ID   3.1.1.34
    DE   Lipoprotein lipase.
    AN   Clearing factor lipase.
    AN   Diacylglycerol lipase.
    AN   Diglyceride lipase.
    CA   Triacylglycerol + H(2)O = diacylglycerol + a carboxylate.
    CC   -!- Hydrolyzes triacylglycerols in chylomicrons and very low-density
    CC       lipoproteins (VLDL).
    CC   -!- Also hydrolyzes diacylglycerol.
    PR   PROSITE; PDOC00110;
    DR   P11151, LIPL_BOVIN ;  P11153, LIPL_CAVPO ;  P11602, LIPL_CHICK ;
    DR   P55031, LIPL_FELCA ;  P06858, LIPL_HUMAN ;  P11152, LIPL_MOUSE ;
    DR   O46647, LIPL_MUSVI ;  P49060, LIPL_PAPAN ;  P49923, LIPL_PIG   ;
    DR   Q06000, LIPL_RAT   ;  Q29524, LIPL_SHEEP ;
    //

In this example, the first line shows the EC (Enzyme Commission) number
of lipoprotein lipase (second line). Alternative names of lipoprotein
lipase are "clearing factor lipase", "diacylglycerol lipase", and
"diglyceride lipase" (lines 3 through 5). The line starting with "CA"
shows the catalytic activity of this enzyme. Comment lines start with
"CC". The "PR" line shows references to the Prosite Documentation
records, and the "DR" lines show references to Swiss-Prot records. Not
of these entries are necessarily present in an Enzyme record.

In Biopython, an Enzyme record is represented by the
``Bio.ExPASy.Enzyme.Record`` class. This record derives from a Python
dictionary and has keys corresponding to the two-letter codes used in
Enzyme files. To read an Enzyme file containing one Enzyme record, use
the ``read`` function in ``Bio.ExPASy.Enzyme``:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import Enzyme
    >>> handle = open("lipoprotein.txt")
    >>> record = Enzyme.read(handle)
    >>> record["ID"]
    '3.1.1.34'
    >>> record["DE"]
    'Lipoprotein lipase.'
    >>> record["AN"]
    ['Clearing factor lipase.', 'Diacylglycerol lipase.', 'Diglyceride lipase.']
    >>> record["CA"]
    'Triacylglycerol + H(2)O = diacylglycerol + a carboxylate.'
    >>> record["PR"]
    ['PDOC00110']

.. code:: python

    >>> record["CC"]
    ['Hydrolyzes triacylglycerols in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins
    (VLDL).', 'Also hydrolyzes diacylglycerol.']
    >>> record["DR"]
    [['P11151', 'LIPL_BOVIN'], ['P11153', 'LIPL_CAVPO'], ['P11602', 'LIPL_CHICK'],
    ['P55031', 'LIPL_FELCA'], ['P06858', 'LIPL_HUMAN'], ['P11152', 'LIPL_MOUSE'],
    ['O46647', 'LIPL_MUSVI'], ['P49060', 'LIPL_PAPAN'], ['P49923', 'LIPL_PIG'],
    ['Q06000', 'LIPL_RAT'], ['Q29524', 'LIPL_SHEEP']]

The ``read`` function raises a ValueError if no Enzyme record is found,
and also if more than one Enzyme record is found.

The full set of Enzyme records can be downloaded as a single file
(``enzyme.dat``) from the `ExPASy FTP
site <ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/enzyme/enzyme.dat>`__, containing
4877 records (release of 3 March 2009). To parse such a file containing
multiple Enzyme records, use the ``parse`` function in
``Bio.ExPASy.Enzyme`` to obtain an iterator:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import Enzyme
    >>> handle = open("enzyme.dat")
    >>> records = Enzyme.parse(handle)

We can now iterate over the records one at a time. For example, we can
make a list of all EC numbers for which an Enzyme record is available:

.. code:: python

    >>> ecnumbers = [record["ID"] for record in records]

10.5  Accessing the ExPASy server
---------------------------------

Swiss-Prot, Prosite, and Prosite documentation records can be downloaded
from the ExPASy web server at
`http://www.expasy.org <http://www.expasy.org>`__. Six kinds of
queries are available from ExPASy:

**get\_prodoc\_entry**
    To download a Prosite documentation record in HTML format
**get\_prosite\_entry**
    To download a Prosite record in HTML format
**get\_prosite\_raw**
    To download a Prosite or Prosite documentation record in raw format
**get\_sprot\_raw**
    To download a Swiss-Prot record in raw format
**sprot\_search\_ful**
    To search for a Swiss-Prot record
**sprot\_search\_de**
    To search for a Swiss-Prot record

To access this web server from a Python script, we use the
``Bio.ExPASy`` module.

10.5.1  Retrieving a Swiss-Prot record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s say we are looking at chalcone synthases for Orchids (see
section \ `2.3 <#sec:orchids>`__ for some justification for looking for
interesting things about orchids). Chalcone synthase is involved in
flavanoid biosynthesis in plants, and flavanoids make lots of cool
things like pigment colors and UV protectants.

If you do a search on Swiss-Prot, you can find three orchid proteins for
Chalcone Synthase, id numbers O23729, O23730, O23731. Now, let’s write a
script which grabs these, and parses out some interesting information.

First, we grab the records, using the ``get_sprot_raw()`` function of
``Bio.ExPASy``. This function is very nice since you can feed it an id
and get back a handle to a raw text record (no html to mess with!). We
can the use ``Bio.SwissProt.read`` to pull out the Swiss-Prot record, or
``Bio.SeqIO.read`` to get a SeqRecord. The following code accomplishes
what I just wrote:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import ExPASy
    >>> from Bio import SwissProt

    >>> accessions = ["O23729", "O23730", "O23731"]
    >>> records = []

    >>> for accession in accessions:
    ...     handle = ExPASy.get_sprot_raw(accession)
    ...     record = SwissProt.read(handle)
    ...     records.append(record)

If the accession number you provided to ``ExPASy.get_sprot_raw`` does
not exist, then ``SwissProt.read(handle)`` will raise a ``ValueError``.
You can catch ``ValueException`` exceptions to detect invalid accession
numbers:

.. code:: python

    >>> for accession in accessions:
    ...     handle = ExPASy.get_sprot_raw(accession)
    ...     try:
    ...         record = SwissProt.read(handle)
    ...     except ValueException:
    ...         print "WARNING: Accession %s not found" % accession
    ...     records.append(record)

10.5.2  Searching Swiss-Prot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, you may remark that I knew the records’ accession numbers
beforehand. Indeed, ``get_sprot_raw()`` needs either the entry name or
an accession number. When you don’t have them handy, you can use one of
the ``sprot_search_de()`` or ``sprot_search_ful()`` functions.

``sprot_search_de()`` searches in the ID, DE, GN, OS and OG lines;
``sprot_search_ful()`` searches in (nearly) all the fields. They are
detailed on
`http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/sprot-search-de <http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/sprot-search-de>`__
and
`http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/sprot-search-ful <http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/sprot-search-ful>`__
respectively. Note that they don’t search in TrEMBL by default (argument
``trembl``). Note also that they return html pages; however, accession
numbers are quite easily extractable:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import ExPASy
    >>> import re

    >>> handle = ExPASy.sprot_search_de("Orchid Chalcone Synthase")
    >>> # or:
    >>> # handle = ExPASy.sprot_search_ful("Orchid and {Chalcone Synthase}")
    >>> html_results = handle.read()
    >>> if "Number of sequences found" in html_results:
    ...     ids = re.findall(r'HREF="/uniprot/(\w+)"', html_results)
    ... else:
    ...     ids = re.findall(r'href="/cgi-bin/niceprot\.pl\?(\w+)"', html_results)

10.5.3  Retrieving Prosite and Prosite documentation records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prosite and Prosite documentation records can be retrieved either in
HTML format, or in raw format. To parse Prosite and Prosite
documentation records with Biopython, you should retrieve the records in
raw format. For other purposes, however, you may be interested in these
records in HTML format.

To retrieve a Prosite or Prosite documentation record in raw format, use
``get_prosite_raw()``. For example, to download a Prosite record and
print it out in raw text format, use

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import ExPASy
    >>> handle = ExPASy.get_prosite_raw('PS00001')
    >>> text = handle.read()
    >>> print text

To retrieve a Prosite record and parse it into a ``Bio.Prosite.Record``
object, use

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import ExPASy
    >>> from Bio import Prosite
    >>> handle = ExPASy.get_prosite_raw('PS00001')
    >>> record = Prosite.read(handle)

The same function can be used to retrieve a Prosite documentation record
and parse it into a ``Bio.ExPASy.Prodoc.Record`` object:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import ExPASy
    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import Prodoc
    >>> handle = ExPASy.get_prosite_raw('PDOC00001')
    >>> record = Prodoc.read(handle)

For non-existing accession numbers, ``ExPASy.get_prosite_raw`` returns a
handle to an emptry string. When faced with an empty string,
``Prosite.read`` and ``Prodoc.read`` will raise a ValueError. You can
catch these exceptions to detect invalid accession numbers.

The functions ``get_prosite_entry()`` and ``get_prodoc_entry()`` are
used to download Prosite and Prosite documentation records in HTML
format. To create a web page showing one Prosite record, you can use

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import ExPASy
    >>> handle = ExPASy.get_prosite_entry('PS00001')
    >>> html = handle.read()
    >>> output = open("myprositerecord.html", "w")
    >>> output.write(html)
    >>> output.close()

and similarly for a Prosite documentation record:

.. code:: python

    >>> from Bio import ExPASy
    >>> handle = ExPASy.get_prodoc_entry('PDOC00001')
    >>> html = handle.read()
    >>> output = open("myprodocrecord.html", "w")
    >>> output.write(html)
    >>> output.close()

For these functions, an invalid accession number returns an error
message in HTML format.

10.6  Scanning the Prosite database
-----------------------------------

`ScanProsite <http://www.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/>`__ allows you to
scan protein sequences online against the Prosite database by providing
a UniProt or PDB sequence identifier or the sequence itself. For more
information about ScanProsite, please see the `ScanProsite
documentation <http://www.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/scanprosite-doc.html>`__
as well as the `documentation for programmatic access of
ScanProsite <http://www.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/ScanPrositeREST.html>`__.

You can use Biopython’s ``Bio.ExPASy.ScanProsite`` module to scan the
Prosite database from Python. This module both helps you to access
ScanProsite programmatically, and to parse the results returned by
ScanProsite. To scan for Prosite patterns in the following protein
sequence:

.. code:: python

    MEHKEVVLLLLLFLKSGQGEPLDDYVNTQGASLFSVTKKQLGAGSIEECAAKCEEDEEFT
    CRAFQYHSKEQQCVIMAENRKSSIIIRMRDVVLFEKKVYLSECKTGNGKNYRGTMSKTKN

you can use the following code:

.. code:: python

    >>> sequence = "MEHKEVVLLLLLFLKSGQGEPLDDYVNTQGASLFSVTKKQLGAGSIEECAAKCEEDEEFT
    CRAFQYHSKEQQCVIMAENRKSSIIIRMRDVVLFEKKVYLSECKTGNGKNYRGTMSKTKN"
    >>> from Bio.ExPASy import ScanProsite
    >>> handle = ScanProsite.scan(seq=sequence)

By executing ``handle.read()``, you can obtain the search results in raw
XML format. Instead, let’s use ``Bio.ExPASy.ScanProsite.read`` to parse
the raw XML into a Python object:

.. code:: python

    >>> result = ScanProsite.read(handle)
    >>> type(result)
    <class 'Bio.ExPASy.ScanProsite.Record'>

A ``Bio.ExPASy.ScanProsite.Record`` object is derived from a list, with
each element in the list storing one ScanProsite hit. This object also
stores the number of hits, as well as the number of search sequences, as
returned by ScanProsite. This ScanProsite search resulted in six hits:

.. code:: python

    >>> result.n_seq
    1
    >>> result.n_match
    6
    >>> len(result)
    6
    >>> result[0]
    {'signature_ac': u'PS50948', 'level': u'0', 'stop': 98, 'sequence_ac': u'USERSEQ1', 'start': 16, 'score': u'8.873'}
    >>> result[1]

Other ScanProsite parameters can be passed as keyword arguments; see the
`documentation for programmatic access of
ScanProsite <http://www.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/ScanPrositeREST.html>`__
for more information. As an example, passing ``lowscore=1`` to include
matches with low level scores lets use find one additional hit:

.. code:: python

    >>> handle = ScanProsite.scan(seq=sequence, lowscore=1)
    >>> result = ScanProsite.read(handle)
    >>> result.n_match
    7
